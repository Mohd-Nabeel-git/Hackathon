                    <h2>Introduction to Anti-Doping</h2>
                    <h3>Brief overview of what doping is and why it’s harmful.</h3>
                    <p>Anti-doping refers to the policies, rules, and practices designed to prevent the use of
                        performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) and methods in sports. The goal is to maintain fairness,
                        protect athletes’ health, and preserve the integrity of sports.Key Elements of Anti-Doping:World
                        Anti-Doping Agency (WADA): Established in 1999, WADA is the global body responsible for
                        promoting, coordinating, and monitoring the fight against doping. It sets out the World
                        Anti-Doping Code, which is the framework for harmonized anti-doping policies
                        worldwide.Prohibited Substances and Methods: WADA maintains a Prohibited List of substances and
                        methods that are banned in sports. This list is updated annually and includes:Anabolic agents
                        (steroids)Hormones (e.g., EPO, growth hormone)StimulantsNarcoticsGene dopingBlood dopingTesting
                        and Monitoring: Anti-doping agencies conduct in-competition and out-of-competition testing. This
                        includes urine and blood samples to detect banned substances. Testing can be random or targeted
                        based on suspicions of doping.</p>

                    <h2>Importance of clean sports for health, fairness, and integrity</h2>
                    <p><b>1.</b> Fair Competition:Doping provides athletes with an unfair advantage, which distorts the
                        essence of competition. Anti-doping efforts ensure that all athletes compete on an equal playing
                        field based on their natural abilities, training, and dedication.Fair competition is the
                        foundation of sports, where talent, hard work, and skill should determine success, not the use
                        of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs).<br><br>
                        <b>2.</b> Protecting Athletes' Health:Many banned substances, such as anabolic steroids,
                        stimulants, and hormones, have dangerous health consequences, including heart disease, liver
                        damage, psychological issues, and even death.Young and aspiring athletes might be tempted to
                        dope to succeed, often unaware of the long-term risks. Anti-doping efforts protect athletes from
                        these physical and mental health risks by discouraging and preventing the use of harmful
                        substances.<br><br>
                        <b>3.</b> Preserving the Integrity of Sports:Doping scandals damage the credibility of sports.
                        When athletes use PEDs, the legitimacy of their achievements is questioned, which undermines the
                        trust of fans, sponsors, and governing bodies.Anti-doping efforts help maintain the reputation
                        and credibility of sports as a symbol of human excellence and achievement.4. Role Models and
                        Ethical Standards:Athletes serve as role models for society, especially for young people.
                        Anti-doping reinforces the message that success should come through hard work, perseverance, and
                        integrity, not through cheating or shortcuts.Upholding ethical standards in sports contributes
                        to a positive culture in which values like honesty, fairness, and respect are
                        prioritized.<br><br>
